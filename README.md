# NN-interaction-OPE-Renormalization-S-wave
Study of the nucleon–nucleon ($NN$ interaction in the $^{1}S_0$ channel using Effective Field Theory (EFT). The long-range interaction is given by one-pion exchange, while short-range physics is described by contact terms. The Lippmann–Schwinger equation is solved using DR and DWT.
